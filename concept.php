                <p>The Animals and Birds Life Care Organization (ABLCO) is a registered non-state and not for profit
                  development Organization, established to render Socio-economic transformation services in the Animals,
                  Birds and other creatures greater sector in Uganda for sustainable development.
                  Our Vision is seeing a Uganda where citizens promote, uphold and appreciate the rights of animals and
                  birds for sustainable development...</p>
                <p id="p-1-readmore" class="d-none"> Our Mission therefore, is to promote holistic transformation in the

                  The organization comes into Uganda to trigger the respect for Animals birds and other creatures to
                  oversee the full implementation of their rights. There is an outcry in Uganda in the way the animals
                  and birds’ rights are preserved, protected and upheld.</br>

              </h2>

              <div class="entry-content">
                <p>
                  ABLCO’s concern is deeply rooted in the way this great sector is unfairly managed, legislated and
                  transformed to cause any significant wealth creation for Uganda and her peoples. Strategic challenges
                  into this sector range from the way Ugandan animals and birds are mishandled on farms and homes inform
                  of harassment, beatings, held on steel chains and ropes tied in the neck, legs/arms... </p>
                <div id="p-2-readmore" class="d-none">
                  <p> The level of bestiality has risen too where people are found sleeping with animals. Animals are
                    kept in poorly hygienic places with low ventilation, dirty places full of their urine and droppings
                    making the animals to fall sick and most times loss of their lives. Slaughter houses are in dire
                    hygienic conditions some without clean water and mostly face foul smell.</p>
                  <p> The continuous degradation of the environment through human activities like deforestation for
                    charcoal burning and firewood, brick laying removing the top most layer of the soil for bricks, sand
                    mining, stone quarying, swamp and wetland reclamation. This has contributed to the climate crisis
                    tampering with our seasons leading to low production in the Agricultural sector due to unreliability
                    in seasons changes and landslides (Bududa).</p>
                  <p> With all this impunity in the environment which harbors most of animals and birds has proved to be
                    at an alarming rate and that if not attended to swiftly we have animals and birds that are bound to
                    go into extinction/endangered animals and birds like mountain gorillas, chimpanzee, crested crane,
                    African wild dog and African savanna elephant. “With every animal species that fade to extinction,
                    one more opportunity is lost from the realm of human growth and possibility.” Laurence Overmire, the
                    one idea that saves the world. The current rate at which poaching is taking place in gazetted areas
                    by smugglers and unlicensed animal dealers and traffickers is a cause for an alarm for example we
                    lost six mountain climbing Lions in Queen Elizabeth National Park last year. Transport means
                    especially animals and birds transported via roads are usually overloaded on lorries, motorcycles,
                    biclyes, tied with ropes in the necks and due to this by the time they reach the market/home they
                    are already dead.</p>
